Hi! My name is Ayden Shankman, I am currently a student at The Cooper Union studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a planned graduation date of May 2023. I plan to get a Masters in Electrical Engineering by December 2023. I love creating, coding, building, and problem solving. This Github is a collection of all the programming I've worked on for school or projects I've done. Below are some of the projects I've done for school.

* [Data Structures and Algorithms II](https://github.com/Shankface/DSA2) (C++)
* [Operating Systems](https://github.com/Shankface/OperatingSystems) (C)
* [Signals](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE211) (Matlab)
* [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE467-NLP) (Python)
* [Probability Models and Stochastic Processes](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE302-ProbModels) (Matlab)
