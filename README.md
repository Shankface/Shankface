Hi! My name is Ayden Shankman, I am currently a student at The Cooper Union studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a planned graduation date of May 2023. I plan to get a Masters in Electrical Engineering by December 2023. I love creating, coding, building, and problem solving. This Github is a collection of all the programming I've worked on for school or projects I've done. Below are some of the projects I've done for school.
